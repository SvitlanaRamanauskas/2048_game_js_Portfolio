## Overview

The game was built with the following technologies:
- **JavaScript**: The core logic and functionality of the game are implemented in JavaScript.
- **Events**: The game uses JavaScript event handling to capture user inputs and trigger game actions.

## Development

The game was developed using the JavaScript programming language, leveraging event-driven programming to handle user interactions. Key aspects include:

- **Event Listeners**: JavaScript event listeners are used to detect and respond to keyboard input for moving tiles.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The game board updates in real-time based on user actions and game state changes.
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions and animations enhance the gameplay experience.

## About the game

2048 was first created in 2014 by Italian programmer Gabriele Cirulli and has since become a popular casual mobile and web-based game.
2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game board starts with two tiles with the number 2, and the player must repeatedly combine tiles of the same number to double their value until reaching the 2048 tile. Each successful combination creates a new tile with the combined value. The gameplay involves strategically sliding the tiles in one of four directions (up, down, left, or right) to position them for successful combinations. As the game progresses, higher-numbered tiles are created, and the challenge increases to reach the 2048 tile before the board fills up.
